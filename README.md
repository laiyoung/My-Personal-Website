# My-Personal-Website
My Personal Website contains 3 HTML pages, along with a CSS style page and a JavaScript file.
For this project, I focused on grasping the concepts of a navigation bar and footer, while keeping the page components more simple.

## CSS Features Implemented
A hover selector was implemented to allow for navigation links to be highlighted. This selector was used both in the header navigaton and the footer navigation.

A float property was utilized to move the navigation links from the edge of the 
navigation bar. 

The text-align property was used to center headers and used to format paragraphs in justify.
